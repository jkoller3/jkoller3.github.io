					Dear Dr. K, <br> 
Thank you for refilling my prescription.
<br>
If you're able and it's not a burden, would you be willing to send my professor a letter or document notifying him of my condition? 
<br>
I'll explain what happened:
<br>
I failed to submit an exam by midnight last night and since he has a zero tolerance policy for exams in terms of late submissions, my 12:30am submission wasn't accepted. This is incredibly stark because the lowest grade I earned all semester prior to this zero was a ninety-five; I earned a ninety-eight on the midterm. 
<br>
Because the final accounts for thirty percent of the grade, however, I'm set to fail the semester because the lowest grade for a passing mark is a seventy-three. 
<br>
    To keep it relatively simple, I had a week to complete the exam, but I was only able to start it around day four. This was because I was feeling slightly depressive. Instead of catching up on the C language and threading methods to answer the questions, I drew in my pad and read The Second Sex. By midnight of last night, I was so exhausted and had experienced such tremendous tunnel vision while tidying up one of the questions that I completely forgot to check for 11:59pm on my clock. By that time it was 12:30am. 
<br>
            My professor, who taught a course I took last semester, reached out because I had just omitted a final exam score after two semesters of consecutive high-nineties grades. I told him I was okay with the result and thanked him for two great semesters, completely failing to grasp that I'll have to take the class again in the Fall. 
            <br>
            He and I spoke this morning and he told me that if I can produce a document from you explaining my condition and perhaps that I've been hospitalized in the past, he would let me submit my work for a grade. For what it's worth, he noted that someone in his family has bipolar disorder, as well, so he's sympathetic to this.

            ** P.s. Just to clarify: ** <br>
To clarify on the content of my recent symptomatology (and I sincerely apologize for the length of my writing) :

            1.<br>
I blame my condition for this massive blunder and so must emphasize that I had no intention of falling back on your support to excuse my lack of performance. 

            <br>
            2. <br>
            About a week ago I felt a sudden and  deeply existential dread that concluded with a discussion with my girlfriend. This dread revolved around my independence and role as someone who should be helping the women in my life, her and my younger sister, comprehend a solid feminism by examining Simone de Beauvoir's reflections. My girlfriend is from China and my sister has a hard time with reading and comprehension, and I felt somehow guilty for their not knowing about feminism. I've decided to start working on a blog to force myself to express myself, finally.

            3.<br>
What's more is, and please don't be alarmed by this, but during the latter stages I was conducting a massive round of magical thinking. I knew that I was taking a huge risk by not submitting this on time. The tunnel vision was partly my pride over completing the problem and not wanting to submit to the fear that somehow my intuition that completing one more problem would magically vindicate me for submitting my exam later. <br>
            All I needed to do was submit 2 out of 4 of the problems' answers, which I completed, and I would have a B for the class. 
            <br><br>
            Again, I'm really sorry for the flurry of emails today. This is my favorite means of communicating details which are very difficult to type, let alone speak about. I feel horrible that this happened. I would be immensely grateful if you could help me.
