		"Flowers And You"
		
		</b>
		</h3>																																																	
I'm heartsick and well rehearsed<br>
Highly decorated with a badge that reads "It could be worse"<br>
So prideful I choose to live in disguise<br>
With a levee set for my heavy eyes<br>
<br>
I apologize for the grief<br>
When you'd refuse to eat<br>
I didn't know just what to say<br>
While watching you wither away<br>
<br>
I'm homesick and living in the past<br>
Seemingly unfazed and strong if anyone asks<br>
I'm keeping up appereances with white lies<br>
With a levee set for my heavy eyes<br>
<br>
I apologize for the grief<br>
When you'd talk about belief<br>
I didn't know just what to say<br>
While watching you wither away<br>
<br>
It was time this whole time<br>
We can't undo or rewind<br>
<br>
Just a simple conversation about nothing much at all<br>
Couldn't keep me in the room, I just kept walking down the hall<br>
But now I understand just what a fool I'd been<br>
No matter what the context, I won't have that time again<br>
(and I live with that)<br>
<br>
I took inventory of what I took for granted<br>
And I ended up with more than I imagined<br>
I've kept it bottled up and to myself in the cellar<br>
Kept for my everchanging mental health<br>
