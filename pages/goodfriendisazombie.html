<h3> My Good Friend is a Zombie</h3>
<br>

All of my blessings and curses dance together to formulate my moments and dizzying nighttimes. When I draw, I etch misguided shapes. These shapes are characters and so they’re misguided characters. <br>
I think that when I draw, I am putting into an image what I would see if the emotions and frustrations being released in this process were instead released in the relaxation preceding sleep and dreams. <br>
It’s just a theory but maybe it makes an inkling of sense: when you relax into sleep you in some way release your frustrations by letting go of your control over yourself. <br>
For anyone who enjoys being pleasured, that can be utterly cathartic and so I doubt it’s questioned much if falling asleep is cathartic, too, because they're basically the same thing. <br><br>

What comes to my mind now that I’ve completed a sketch is the trouble I’m having with a person who has been like a close friend to me for some five or odd years. <br>
We grew up in the same town and went to school together. After school ended, as I was gearing up to go to college, he reached out and convinced me to try to get high. <br>
Who I am today is completely dependent on that yesterday when I injected my throat with my first register of highfalutin dissociation from the anxieties of my default settings. <br>
I nearly lost a friend from this because he wanted to be the first person that I smoked with and my girlfriend was horrified. So much so that her girlfriend called me on the phone and screeched insults into the earpiece while I shifted my feet between the leaves in the woods that the first bowl was torched. <br>
When I saw my now ex-girlfriend’s girlfriend years later I saw that she had a pretty accurate assessment of the weight the drug had; her voice had departed her cords and she moped around her bedroom like a pale zombie, touting faux-urban parlance. Her face was also incapable of self-expression and clothes were strewn about the place. The place smelled like a specifically female rot. It reminded me of my ex-girlfriend’s residential state, which had just stomached her father’s incarceration and the death of a puppy which I named. I didn’t venture to stay for the evening; the tour of the house was plenty for me at that point. I mean that for both of them. That’s why I left her and didn’t try to kiss this girl who was previously (in my memory) a really captivating person.<br><br>

Well, now I’m caught awake again. It’s nearing four and I’m not nearly halfway to tired because I simply need to work at bizarre hours to be productive. This could be owing to the fact that I live with my parents still, but I really think it’s because the sunlight and the picturesque landscape in this early summertime is much too appealing for me to churn out commands for a server or website. I also can’t think half-clearly about my emotions or my demons. <br>
I wonder if I ever needed to try getting high to be who I am today, replete as I am with a ton of deeply fascinating topics. I also wonder if I would have ever been put in a hospital and if I would have ever needed to work at bizarre hours to keep up this new career in freelance content creation.
